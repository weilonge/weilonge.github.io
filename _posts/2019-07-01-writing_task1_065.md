Dear Sir/Madam,

Iâ€™m writing to apply for the holiday job which you advertised recently in the newspaper. I am a twenty-one-year-old student and I speak English quite well. At present I am in my second year studying History at Lincoln College and I am very keen to have a holiday job this summer. I am extremely good at adding up, so I think I would be an asset to your shop.

My term finishes on 5th July and I am free until 20th September. Last year I worked in a restaurant serving tourists from all over the world and I enjoyed it very much. I would like to have the opportunity to meet people and practise my English again.

I enjoy going to museums and am particularly keen on history. Last year I went to an exhibition of Ancient Greek objects which was held in London. I have often been in your museum and am familiar with the items you have. I do hope you will be interested in my application.

I look forward to hearing from you in the near future.

Yours faithfully,

Dimitris Boudramis
